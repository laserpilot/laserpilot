### Hello!

My name is Blair Neal and I'm a creative technologist based in NYC. 

I enjoy writing about many topics related to creative technology in the professional space and sharing as much as I can about what I learn. Find more [here.](https://ablairneal.com/writing)

Formerly, from 2010 to 2020, I was the Chief Creative Technologist at Fake Love, an experiential agency that was owned by the New York Times. You can read more about Fake Love [here](https://ablairneal.com/project/fake-love)
